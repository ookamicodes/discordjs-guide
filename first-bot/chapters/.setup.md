# Project Setup

This is the beginning of a new project. But how should you start? First if you never coded, then you should know the basic of JS/Nodejs. It makes everything easier. Do not forget to install nodejs & npm on your computer!

The first things you need are:

- Bot Token (You can get these on Discord Developer Website)
- Source code editor

Open your Source code editor and go to the terminal. Do `npm init`and click enter till the end. After that do `npm i discord.js`to install the discord.js library. You now downloaded the library and can start coding.
